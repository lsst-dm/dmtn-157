\caption{
Run summary of the HSC-RC2 workflow with different setups.
The workflow wall time only includes Pegasus records, and may be dominated by random job failures and the rescue graph.
The costs are overestimates.
The Postgres instance size was increased between the 20200802T164424 run and the 20200804T005441 run; it stayed the same afterwards.
